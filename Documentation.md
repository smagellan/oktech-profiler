If you are not interested in the deep details of the profiler, you might check the [Quick Start Guide](QuickStartGuide.md).

The following items will give you a deeper understanding how the profiler works and how you can fine-tune it:
  * The [project structure](ProjectStructure.md) gives a brief introduction about the source code, dependencies and the build process.
  * The [local Java agent](LocalJavaAgent.md) and the [remote JMX connection](RemoteJmxConnection.md) describes the two major way you can use the profiler.
  * The [thread sampling](ThreadSampling.md), the [memory sampling](MemorySampling.md) and the [instrumentation](Instrumentation.md) describes how the profiler collects its data. The requirements and the implications are described separately, but you might be interested in the [sampling vs instrumentation](SamplingVsInstrumentation.md) article too.
  * The [tree report](TreeReport.md) is our only report at the moment, available in textual and XML formats.

Furthermore, you might check the [planned features](PlannedFeatures.md) and the [release notes](ReleaseNotes.md).
